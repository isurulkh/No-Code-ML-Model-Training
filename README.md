# No-Code ML Model Training App

A Streamlit application enabling users to easily train machine learning models without needing to write code. Users can upload datasets, select machine learning algorithms, and train models to make predictions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isurulkh/No-Code-ML-Model-Training.git
cd No-Code-ML-Model-Training
  ```
2.**Create a virtual environment:**

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  
  ```
3.**Create a virtual environment:**

  * **Windows**
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
